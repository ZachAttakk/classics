# Coding the Classics

This is the repository of coding files for the YouTube Channel [Zach Attakk Codes](https://www.youtube.com/@ZachAttakkCodes) where we code simple games to learn to code!

We upload the code file at the end of each episode so you can follow along. If you'd like to code along, grab the file from the previous episode.
